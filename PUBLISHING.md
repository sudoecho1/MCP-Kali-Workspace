# Publishing MCP Kali Workspace to VS Code Marketplace

## Prerequisites

1. **Create a Publisher Account**
   - Go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
   - Sign in with Microsoft account
   - Create a publisher ID (replace `your-publisher-name` in package.json)

2. **Get a Personal Access Token (PAT)**
   - Go to https://dev.azure.com
   - User Settings → Personal Access Tokens
   - Create new token with `Marketplace (Manage)` scope
   - Save the token securely

## Steps to Publish

### 1. Update Publisher ID

Edit `package.json`:
```json
"publisher": "your-actual-publisher-id"
```

### 2. Add an Icon (Optional but Recommended)

Create or download a 128x128 PNG icon and save as `icon.png` in the extension root.

### 3. Update Repository URL

Edit `package.json`:
```json
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-kali-workspace"
}
```

### 4. Login to Publisher

```bash
npx vsce login your-publisher-id
```

Enter your PAT when prompted.

### 5. Package and Publish

```bash
# Package
npm run package

# Publish
npx vsce publish
```

Or do both in one step:
